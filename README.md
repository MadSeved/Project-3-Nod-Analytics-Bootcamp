# Project-3-Nod-Analytics-Bootcamp
Project 3 of the Bootcamp is on the topic of Big Data Analysis. This project approaches this topic by analyzing a huge amount of video game player data.

More specifically, the game in question is Ubisoft's "Rainbow Six Siege" and the data is obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/. The main question I wanted to answer is how to optimize a teams winrate in the game whilst at the same time considering certain, very simple, economical factors.

Note: the csv files used in the project are too big to be uploaded onto GitHub. However, these files can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/maxcobra/rainbow-six-siege-s5-ranked-dataset
